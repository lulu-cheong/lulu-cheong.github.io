The Self-Determination Program (SDP) in California is a voluntary initiative that empowers individuals with developmental disabilities to have greater control over the services and supports they receive through their regional center. Established by Senate Bill 468 in 2013 and expanded statewide in July 2021, the SDP offers an alternative to traditional regional center services, providing participants with more freedom, authority, and responsibility in choosing services that align with their personal goals and preferences.
